Welcome to this tutorial about Octane renderer

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today we will learn about Keyframe animation

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
First, let's set up the Effective Path

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Then we'll adjust the F曲线 for smooth motion (音乐)

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
The Render Engine in Maya is very powerful

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,000
You can also use Houdini for procedural modeling

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
The Viewport shows real-time preview (哼哼)

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Arnold and Redshift are both great renderers

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Don't forget to optimize your Mesh topology

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Use Shader nodes to create realistic materials
